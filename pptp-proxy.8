.Sh NAME
.Nm pptp-proxy
.Nd PPTP proxy daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pptp-proxy
.Op Fl 6d
.Op Fl a Ar address
.Op Fl b Ar address
.Op Fl D Ar level
.Op Fl m Ar maxsessions
.Op Fl P Ar port
.Op Fl p Ar port
.Op Fl R Ar address
.Op Fl t Ar timeout
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a proxy for the Internet Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol.
PPTP control connections should be redirected into the proxy using the
.Xr pf 4
.Ar rdr
command, after which the proxy connects to the server on behalf of
the client.
.Pp
The proxy handles GRE tunnels in the same way. Server incoming GRE packet
are forwarded to the correct client based on the GRE call-id header.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl 6
IPv6 mode.
The proxy will expect and use IPv6 addresses for all communication.
The proxy is in IPv4 mode by default.
.It Fl a Ar address
The proxy will use this as the source address for the control
connection to a server.
.It Fl b Ar address
Address where the proxy will listen for redirected control connections.
The default is 127.0.0.1, or ::1 in IPv6 mode.
.It Fl D Ar level
Debug level, ranging from 0 to 7.
Higher is more verbose.
The default is 5.
(These levels correspond to the
.Xr syslog 3
levels.)
.It Fl d
Do not daemonize.
The process will stay in the foreground, logging to standard error.
.It Fl m Ar maxsessions
Maximum number of concurrent PPTP sessions.
When the proxy reaches this limit, new connections are denied.
The default is 100.
.It Fl P Ar port
Fixed server port.
Only used in combination with
.Fl R .
The default is port 1723.
.It Fl p Ar port
Port where the proxy will listen for redirected connections.
The default is port 2317.
.It Fl R Ar address
Fixed server address, also known as reverse mode.
The proxy will always connect to the same server, regardless of
where the client wanted to connect to (before it was redirected).
Use this option to proxy for a server behind NAT, or to forward all
connections to another proxy.
.It Fl t Ar timeout
Number of seconds that the control connection can be idle, before the
proxy will disconnect.
The default is 24 hours.
Do not set this too low, because the control connection is usually
idle when large data transfers are taking place.
.El
.Sh CONFIGURATION
To make use of the proxy,
.Xr pf.conf 5
needs the following rules.
All anchors are mandatory.
Adjust the rules as needed.
.Pp
In the NAT section:
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
rdr on $int_if proto gre from any to ! $int_if:0 -> 127.0.0.1
rdr on $int_if proto tcp from any to ! $int_if:0 port 1723 -> \e
    127.0.0.1 port 2317
.Ed
.Pp
In the rule section:
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
pass out proto tcp from $proxy to any port 1723 keep state
pass out proto gre from $proxy to any keep state
